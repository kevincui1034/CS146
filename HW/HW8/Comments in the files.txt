We use a hashmap to count the characters in the string and we want to get even characters
so we check for odd characters. We iterate through the hashmap and if there is an odd
character then we -1 from the hashmap because it cannot form a palindrome. At the end
if there is an odd character then we +1 to the length because the odd character can be placed
in the middle of the palindrome.
