Lab 3

Question 1

1. n^3 if larger because it has a larger power

2.

3. n^logn				2^sqr(n)
	logn(logn)			sqr(n)log2
	log((logn)^2)		log(sqr(n)log2)
	2log(logn)			log(sqr(n)) + loglog2
	2loglogn			log(sqr(n))

4. 2^2n is larger because it's 2 times n.


Question 2

1. Best case: Multiple of 2 at constant time O(1)

2. Worst Case: i*i = n
				 i^2 = n
				 i = sqr(n)

Time complexity: O(sqr(n))

3. Time complexity: O(n)
