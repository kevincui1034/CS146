Initiate an empty stack and prev_node.
While root is not empty or nodes left in the stack, then
traverse to the leftmost node. Appends to stack. Pop the stack and check if value
is greater than the prev_node. Return false if not. Traverse to
the right child of the popped node until tree is traversed.
If any node visited is less than or equal to the previous node, then False.
